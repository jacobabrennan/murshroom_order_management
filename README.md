# Mushroom Order Manager
Order and shipment manager for a small mushroom farm. Employees enter orders received from clients, and the software generates a calendar of innoculation and shipment dates. Created to handle an unexpected surge of orders around the start of Covid-19.

## Technologies in Use
The project consists of a React front-end connecting to a Node.js backend, and performs CRUD operations on a Postgres database. The demo is hosted on an Amazon EC2 server behind an NginX reverse proxy. It serves as an example of a full stack application: from a virtual box in the cloud, through a secure connection, all the way to the user's browser. The system as a whole provides examples of use of the following technologies:
* JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* React
* Postgres
* Node.js
* Express
* Authentication & HTTPS
* NginX
* Amazon Cloud
